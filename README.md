# calculating-your-average-grade-with-JOptionPane
You can calculate your average grade with this code. I made it with JOptionPane without using scanner. You can change the "avgscore" equation if you want to. If you have an idea about something you want to change or add to  code please, let me know. Enjoy it! See ya...
